# Code Quiz For Me

## Description
I wanted to build a timed, multiple-choice quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores. Users can test their knowledge on javascript basics and compare their progress to others by viewing high scores.

In completing this project I learned a lot about storing and retrieving items to local storage. I learned how to sort arrays, including how to reorganize and sort multiple arrays at the same time. It was also provided practice using for loops, event listeners and writing code from scratch.

## Usage
The quiz loads on a start page, which displays instructions on how to begin. Clicking the "start quiz" button displays the quiz: a question with 4 multiple choice options to choose from. The user is informed of correct/incorrect answers as they progress through the quiz, with the option to view their score (click button "view final score") and save their score. When the score is saved, the leaderboard is displayed, showing the top 5 high scores (retrieved from local storage). Scores are sorted in order from highest to lowest, and both the user's initials and their score are displayed. Users are given the choice to return to the start page from the high scores, which reloads the page.

If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.

## License

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
